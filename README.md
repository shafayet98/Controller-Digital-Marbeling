### Paper marbling controller using LiteGraph.js

#### This is a modification of Danniel Shiffman's coding challenge on digital paper marbling. I basically created a user interface that controls the creation of marbling design. 

Using the controller interface:-
1. Circle Radius and Resolution can be controlled.
2. RGB color can be changed + Alpha value can be set
3. Marbling can be created using the mouse action
4. Auto generated marbling design
5. Tine Line controller - change of Z and C value is possible

##### DEMO

1. Cirlce radius and resolution can be changed and marbling can be created using mouse action
